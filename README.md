# Problem Statement
A series of data structures joined by links is called a linked list. A linked list is a collection of links that has objects in it. Every link has an associated link. After arrays, linked lists are the second most used type of data structure. Linked list can be visualized as a chain of nodes. There are two types of linkled list - Singly Linked List and Doubly Linked List. In SLL, every node points to the next node. Whereas in DLL, every node points to its previous node and next node.
